Admission to San Jose State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have
more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this,
SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs.  For the most current
information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website:
<a href="http://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction" target="_blank">www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction</a>
                                                                                
Prior to transferring to San Jose State University all transfers must earn at
least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic
skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have
an approved CSU GE A3 waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units,
students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:
                                                                                
<b>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</b>
Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as
possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU
GE-Breadth 39 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for
this major are shown below.
                                                                                
<b>2. General Education Requirements:</b>                                       
Complete all the CSU GE Breadth requirements at the community college (39
semester units/58 quarter units). The approved courses for each area can be
found at <a href="http://www.ASSIST.org" target="_blank">www.ASSIST.org</a>  under the link "CSU GE-Breadth Certification
Courses" for your college.  Many of these courses may be double counted to meet
the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU
majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the "<a href="http://info.sjsu.edu/web-dbgen/narr/static/schedules/majormod.html" target="_blank">Major
Exceptions and Modifications</a>" page in our catalog.  Please see your college
counselor/advisor to review your general education in order to receive FULL OR
PARTIAL CERTIFICATION PRIOR TO TRANSFER to San Jose State University.
                                                                                
<b>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended:</b>              
All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition
course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either
to meet CSU GE Area A3 or C2) for the greatest success in passing the Writing
Skills Test (WST) at SJSU. Complete this course with a grade of "C" or better
prior to registering for the WST at SJSU to avoid delays in enrollment for other
SJSU courses. To register for the WST contact our Testing office at:
<a href="http://testing.sjsu.edu/wst" target="_blank">http://testing.sjsu.edu/wst</a>
                                                                                
<b>4.</b> <b>American Institutions Requirement</b> (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):  
This requirement is normally 2 courses and can be taken as part of your CSU
GE-Breadth 39 semester unit requirements (GE Area D and sometimes Area C). The
approved courses can be found at <a href="http://www.ASSIST.org" target="_blank">www.ASSIST.org</a>  under the link "CSU US
History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses" for your college.
                                                                                
<b>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</b>  All undergraduate students
who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education
from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an
approved PE waiver.  Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the
 "<a href="http://info.sjsu.edu/web-dbgen/narr/static/schedules/majormod.html" target="_blank">Major Exceptions and Modifications</a>" page in our catalog.

In order to be successful in this major you <b>must</b> complete the following
articulated courses prior to transfer, earning grades of "C" or better on the
first attempt.  Students who struggle to achieve this should strongly consider
selecting a different major.
